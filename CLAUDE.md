# Digital Menagerie

Claude Code plugins for agent design, workflow, and tooling.

## PROJECT SCALE CONTEXT

- **Users:** Single developer (personal plugin marketplace)
- **Codebase:** Small — markdown skills and JSON manifests, no application code
- **Complexity:** Low — plugin structure must conform to Claude Code conventions
- **Process overhead:** Minimal — no CI/CD, no test framework
- **Default approach:** Pragmatic — get plugins working and discoverable

## Plugin Structure

Each plugin lives in its own subdirectory with:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin metadata
- `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — skills (YAML frontmatter must be line 1)

The root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` defines the marketplace and lists all plugins.

## Conventions

- YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md files must start on line 1 (no comments before `---`)
- Follow the directory patterns from the superpowers plugin as reference
- Bump `version` in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` when publishing changes

## kata issue tracker

This project uses [kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata) as its shared issue
ledger. Run `kata quickstart` at the start of each session for the full agent
contract. The short version:

- Search before creating: `kata search "<keywords>" --agent`.
- Prefer updating existing issues over duplicates (`kata comment`, `kata label add`, `kata edit`).
- Default to `--agent` for ordinary reads and mutations; use `--json` only when a script needs structured data.
- Close only verified work: `kata close <ref> --done --message "<scope + verification>" --commit <sha>`.
- If work is incomplete, label `needs-review` and comment what remains rather than closing.
- Never `kata delete` or `kata purge` without explicit user authorization.

## kata work.* conventions (agent orchestration)

When working a kata-tracked issue, keep its `work.*` metadata truthful
(see docs/operations/agent-orchestration.md for the full recipe):

- On claim/start: `kata meta set <ref> work.attention ok`; if the work has a
  dedicated branch, stamp it once with `kata meta set <ref> work.branch <branch>`.
- Signal live state: `kata meta set <ref> work.attention stuck|needs-human|ok`
  plus a one-line `work.attention_msg` saying why. Raise `stuck` when you cannot
  proceed, `needs-human` when you want review; clear back to `ok` when unblocked.
- Never stop with the signal stale: close the issue, or leave the attention
  pair reflecting the hand-off.
- Coordinators read `work.*` on issues they delegated; only the working agent
  writes them. `work.*` on closed issues is meaningless.
